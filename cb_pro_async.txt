In JavaScript, there are several ways to handle asynchronous operations,
including callbacks, promises, and async/await. Here are some of the key
differences between these approaches:

1. Callbacks:
Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions,
and are called when the operation completes. Callbacks can be used
to handle asynchronous operations, but can result in callback hell
when multiple levels of nesting are required to handle multiple 
asynchronous operations. Callback hell can make the code difficult to read
and maintain.

Here's an example of callback hell:

```

```

2. Promises:
Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations in 
a more readable and maintainable way. Promises represent the eventual 
completion of an operation, and provide methods like 
`.then()` and `.catch()` for handling the result of that operation. 
Promises can be chained together to handle multiple asynchronous
operations in a more sequential manner.

Here's an example of using promises:

```
```

3. Async/await:
Async/await is a newer feature of JavaScript that provides a more
synchronous way to handle asynchronous operations. Async/await is built
on top of promises, and provides a way to write asynchronous code that
looks more like synchronous code. Async/await makes it easier to handle 
errors and simplifies the syntax for handling multiple asynchronous
operations.

Here's an example of using async/await:

```
